# 👋 Welcome!

I'm Alex Brito — a Brazilian Web Developer with over 15 years of hands-on experience building reliable, scalable, and high-performance digital solutions.

I’m the founder of INformigados, a technology company focused on creating clean, efficient, and long-term digital solutions for businesses that want more than just “a website.”

I care about clarity. I care about structure. I care about building things that last.

I don’t just write code — I design systems, improve processes, and help ideas become solid digital products.

## 🚀 What I Do

- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React, Tailwind, WordPress)
- Systems Architecture & Integrations
- Performance Optimization & Technical Audits
- Technical Consulting
- Open-source and collaborative projects

## 🎓 Beyond Code

I’m also a Technology and Philosophy professor.

Teaching keeps me sharp. Philosophy keeps me grounded.

Technology moves fast. Critical thinking keeps it meaningful.

For me, engineering without reflection becomes noise — and reflection without execution becomes theory. I work in both worlds.

## 🧠 How I Think

- Clean, maintainable code is non-negotiable  
- Performance is not an extra — it’s part of the product  
- Simplicity scales better than complexity  
- Long-term vision beats short-term hacks  
- Technology must solve real problems
